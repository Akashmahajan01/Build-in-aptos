## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Tier Reward System**:

2. **Interoperable Loyalty Programs**:

   - Allow tokens to be used across different businesses or platforms, creating a universal loyalty program.

3. **Automated Redemption**:
   - Implement automatic token redemption based on predefined customer actions or milestones.

The **LoyaltyRewards** contract strengthens customer relationships by offering a transparent, token-based reward system that incentivizes customer loyalty and engagement.
